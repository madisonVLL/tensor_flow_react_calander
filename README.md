# tensor_flow_react_calander
Over the summer, I want to develop an event-planning website which helps hosts schedule tasks and deadlines, budget, and send reminders of their upcoming obligations. I can ultimately see this project moving in two separate directions; one being used for the everyday party planner who needs help with planning their next birthday party, game-day, etc, while the other camp could be to help students and departments around institutions like our own manage internal ordering deadlines and manage space bookings (however the latter is far more difficult to implement).

Overall, to create an effective task schedule due to the individual task date, I want this project to be more of an exercise in machine learning, hence I will utilize my previous Python programming knowledge to learn how to use TensorFlow and will also rely on my web development skills (html, JavaScript, css, Indexeddb) to hopefully construct the front-end side of this project. The main features that I want to implement are creating an effective task schedule using the event type and event date, creating a budget tracker, and sending email/text notifications to a user when a deadline is coming up. I plan to split my tasks in between learning the basics of TensorFlow, feeding the TensorFlow algorithm data from various websites, and then building the front end of the application.
